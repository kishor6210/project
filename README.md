# project
You are an expert AI engineer.  
Give me the complete end-to-end project steps for a system titled:

"Security and Surveillance: Human and Suspicious Object Detection Using YOLO"

Generate everything in clean bullet points with exact actions I need to do.

Include:
1. Full folder structure for the project  
2. Dataset preparation steps  
3. Roboflow/LabelImg labeling instructions  
4. YOLO (latest version) training script (Python)  
5. YAML file examples  
6. Inference script to detect humans + suspicious objects (gun, knife, bag)  
7. Real-time CCTV/IP camera detection code  
8. Model evaluation steps  
9. Steps for exporting model (ONNX, TensorRT)  
10. Steps to integrate with a simple UI dashboard (Flask/Streamlit)  
11. How to trigger alerts (sound + email + logging)  
12. How to run the project from start to finish  

Make all code blocks executable, simple and production-ready.  
Also explain dependencies, environment setup, and hardware requirements.

Finally, generate a short "How to Present the Project in 2 Minutes" script.
